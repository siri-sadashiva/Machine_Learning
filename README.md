Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. It is one of the leading causes of mortality in patients who are hospitalized. Early prediction of sepsis could allow more aggressive and targeted treatment to prevent further deaths.
